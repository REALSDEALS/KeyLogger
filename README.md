### A simple KeyLogger - Writen in Python.

# Important to Note
This keylogger is purely a demonstration, it's not ment to be used in a malicious way.
Do note that when this is used, it will be found shortly after trying to run it.

You manually have to allow it in Windows ect, since this isn't ment to be used at all, purely for demonstration purposes.

# Why?
Just because I wanted to show it to some other people that asked me to show how it works ect.
